Usually the script will do all the work for you , here is the example for mainline
 
    sudo python kernel-compile.py --type mainline


or for stable default


    sudo python kernel-compile.py
    
    

Default build type is debian way but it can be changed to normal (aka make , make install)

     sudo python kernel-compile.py -b=normal
